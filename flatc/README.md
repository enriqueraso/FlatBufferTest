gen-fbs.ps1 is a PowerShell script that generates code from an input fbs schema. You can specify which flatc.exe version to use and target language you want to generate code.

```
gen-fbs.ps1 {location_of_fbs_schema} [-NewVersion|-FixVersion] [-native|-net|-python|-python2]
```

`NewVersion` will use flatc_23.3.3.exe
`FixVersion` will use flatc_1.15.1.exe
By default, it uses flatc_1.11.1.exe

`python2` will use `--gen-onefile` argument that generates code without creating folder structure. Only in version 23.3.3 creates a file for each type defined in a fbs schema.
